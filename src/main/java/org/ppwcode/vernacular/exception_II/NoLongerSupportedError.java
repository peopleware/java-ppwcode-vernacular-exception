/**
 * Signals that the method throwing this exception no longer supports the promised operation.
 * This is a vehicle in application business's semantics evolution. When business semantics or
 * business logic changes, and a new version is released, we should try to make the old API
 * forward compatible as much as possible. Often, this will not be possible with all methods
 * in all cases. To make it possible to be forward compatible as much as possible, and not be
 * forced to abandon all forward compatibility for one small problem, methods in a business logic
 * API should, from first version, mention that they might, in the future, throw a
 * {@link NoLongerSupportedError}. This is an {@link ExternalError}: the audience in the
 * first place is the organizational architect, which is close to an administrator or a developer.
 * The exception message should express why the method is no longer supported. This exception can
 * be considered a sort of &quot;runtime, distributed deprecated notice&quot;.
