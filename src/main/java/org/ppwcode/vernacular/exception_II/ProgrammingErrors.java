/**
 * <p>When a programming error is detected during execution, an {@link AssertionError} is to be thrown.
 *   This happens, e.g., when the coder notices branches that can never be reached
 *   (<code>else</code>-statements in deep decision trees, or unreachable <code>default</code>-clause in
 *   a <code>switch</code>-statement, or a <code>catch</code>-clause of an exception that can never occur,
 *   when a precondition is violated, ...). The intended audience of these errors is neither the end user,
 *   nor the administrator, but <em>we ourself, the developers</em>.</p>
 *
 * <p>The {@link #getMessage() message} should describe the programming error as closely as possible.
 *   These messages will help you to find the problem if it occurs. Note that for server based
 *   applications (web applications, enterprise applications), debugging in the production environment
 *   is most often plain not possible, and the only available source of information about problems
 *   is a log of the problem as it occurred in the live situation (with desktop applications, certainly
 *   with file based applications, you often can try to replicate the problem with the end user on the
 *   phone, in debug mode). If you cannot pinpoint the exact nature of the programming error, you should
 *   say so explicitly. If you become aware of the programming error by catching an {@link Exception} or
 *   an {@link Error}, it should be carried by instances of this class as the
 *   {@link #getCause() cause}.</p>
 * <p>Instead of constructors, most of the time, the static methods should be used to signal programming
 *   errors. These static methods already feature a message, sparing you the effort. Because we
 *   probably do not foresee all cases, the 1-argument constructor is available too.</p>
 * <p>The best way to think about throwing these errors, is the following. We often document
 *   intricate points of our code. It is better to write assertions as comments, then mere text.
 *   Writing <code><b>assert</b> <i>condition that must be true</i></code> is the best documentation
 *   there is (note that this error should be considered equivalent to an {@link AssertionError}).
 *   It has the glorious benefits over mere comments that, if you are mistaken, you will be warned
 *   immediately, with exact information that points to the exact place of your mistake in thousands
 *   of lines of code. With {@code assert}, you have the benefit that the administrator can choose
 *   whether or not to enable the checks in production. Enabling them will give immediate information
 *   when an error occurs and <em>gives the opportunity to immediately stop processing when an error
 *   occurs, before or immediately after data was corrupted, before the user was given a false expectancy
 *   of success</em>. Disabling them will result in a performance boost (although this should not
 *   be overrated). Throwing a {@code AssertionError} should be preferred over an {@code assert}
 *   statement to document branches that normally should not be reached anyway (n this case, the
 *   performance benefit doesn't occur), or when we want to communicate an exception as part of the
 *   error information. We also use
 *
 *   MUDO MORE DOC
 * <p>These errors should not be mentioned in the exception part of a method contract.
 *   They could be mentioned in the preconditions of a method contract, but in general
 *   this is not appropriate. {@code ExternalError}s are a mechanism to signal
 *   <dfn>system precondition</dfn> violations to administrators, it is not a part of the
 *   contract between developers, but rather a contract between developers in general and
 *   the system administrator. These errors could be documented in a document that
 *   communicates between developers and administrators (e.g., {@code web.xml} for web
 *   applications), and this should be done in specific cases. But most often, these
 *   system preconditions are considered implicit (e.g., when we need a database, it is
 *   implied that the database connection works).</p>
 *
 * <p>It probably does not make sense to create subtypes of this error for specific situations. There
 *   is no need for internationalization for external errors. If there is extra information that we
 *   can communicate, we can add it to the message.</p>
 *
 * @note In draft versions of this vernacular, we introduced a separate {@code AssertionError} for
 *       this, and it would be cleaner if {@link AssertionError} would be a subtype of such a general
 *       {@code AssertionError} throwable. This, however, is not possible. In a second version, we
 *       succeeded in making such a {@code AssertionError} a subtype of {@link AssertionError}.
 *       Yet, it turned out that there was little extra added by this subtype (apart from setting
 *       the cause and message of the error in a controlled fashion, which is now done in the static
 *       methods in this class). To that class, we added a lot of static methods to make documenting
 *       programming errors easier and more consistent. Now it turns out that we can do all of the
 *       necessary work in those static methods, immediately on the existing {@link AssertionError}.
 *       Applying Occam's Razor, the specialized {@code AssertionError} hence disappeared.
