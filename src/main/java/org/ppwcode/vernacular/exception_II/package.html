<p>Vernacular for exceptions. Most exceptions you use should extend one of the classes in this library.</p>
<img src="doc-files/exceptionHierarchy.png" style="width: 100%;"></img>
<p>We discern between <dfn>internal exceptions</dfn>, <dfn>external errors</dfn>, and <dfn>programming errors</dfn>.
  The main criterion to decide which kind to use is the <em>audience</em> for whom a notice of the exceptional
  condition or error is of importance.</p>
<h3>Internal exceptions</h3>
<p>When the exceptional condition is considered <em>internal</em> to your system, i.e., although the condition
  is exceptional and non-nominal, it is expected and normal for your system, i.e., your system is equipped to
  deal with it, you should throw an {@link org.ppwcode.vernacular.exception.InternalException}. The audience
  of these exceptions is the <em>end user</em>. Administrators and developers are not interested in these
  exceptions because their occurence is expected and normal. As a guideline, you can pose yourself the question
  <q>If I communicate this exceptional condition to the end user, can he do something about it?</q> If not,
  you should probably not throw an {@link org.ppwcode.vernacular.exception.InternalException}.</p>
<p>The package
  offers a number of more specialized subclasses of {@link org.ppwcode.vernacular.exception.InternalException},
  and others can be found in other libraries or can be created by you. Since the intended audience of
  {@link org.ppwcode.vernacular.exception.InternalException} is the end user, there should be a mechanism to
  internationalize the message that will be presented to the end user.</p>
<h3>External errors</h3>
<p>When the condition you want to report about is considered a <em>violation of a precondition to the system as
  a whole</em>, i.e., although you know the condition can occur, you have choosen not to deal with it in your
  system, you should throw and {@link org.ppwcode.vernacular.exception.ExternalError}. The audience of these
  errors is the <em>administrator</em>. Developers are not interested in these errors because the issues they
  report is a deployment or operational issue. End users are not interested in the details of these errors,
  because the reason is technical and they can do nothing about it. As a guideline, your can pose yourself the
  question <a>If I communicate this error to the administrator, can he do something about it?</a>. If not,
  you should probably not throw an {@link org.ppwcode.vernacular.exception.ExternalError}.</p>
<p>This package offers no more specialized subclasses of {@link org.ppwcode.vernacular.exception.ExternalError},
  and there probably is little need to create more specialized subclasses. The notice we want to present to
  the administrator should be defined in English when the error is created, with all necessary information
  in the message and causes.</p>
<h3>Programming errors</h3>
<p>When the condition you want to report about is considered a <em>programming error</em>, i.e., although the
  condition is known to be possible on a syntactic level, we can prove it cannot occur, or it should never
  occur in a correct program, you should throw an {@link java.lang.AssertionError}. The audience of these
  errors is the <em>developer</em>. Administrators nor end users are interested in thed details of these errors,
  because the reason is code-bound and they can do nothing about it. As a guideline, your can pose yourself the
  question <q>If I communicate this error to the end user or to the administrator, can he they do someting about
  it?</q> If they can, you should probably not throw an {@link java.lang.AssertionError}.</p>
<p>This package does not offer a special new type for programming errors. The error can be raised by using
  the <code><b>assert</b></code> statement, but it is advisable for the most common cases to use a helper
  method from {@link org.ppwcode.vernacular.exception.ProgrammingErrorHelpers}. No detailed messages are
  needed (a developer can trace the occurence of the exception with a debugger), but they might be helpful,
  especially in a server based program.</p>
<p>There are conditions where we know, in code, that they can only occur when the program contains an
  error. This vernacular is intended for those cases. Note that most programming errors, however, are
  conditions we are not aware of during programming, and thus we cannot take positive action at that
  time (if we knew there was an error, we would not make it). Such programming errors will represent themselves
  often, but not always, as other kinds of unchecked exceptions or errors. Yet other programming errors
  (the worst kind) will not represent themselves quickly at all.</p>
<h3>Other exceptions</h3>
<p>It is not possible for all code you write to know for which audience the message would be appropriate.
  This is often the case in more technical libraries. In those cases, you should throw specialized checked exceptions,
  that do not participate in the hierarchy presented here. User developers of this code, closer to the business
  logic, then should catch these exceptions, and decided to translate them into one of the 3 kinds defined here,
  or deal with them in the nominal flow of their code. As a guideline, if you cannot answer the questions
  presented above in a definite way, you should probably define your own exception hierarchy.</p>
