  <h1>Exceptions Are Important</h1>
  <p>One of the badly understood
  features of modern object oriented programming languages is the importance
  of <dfn>exceptions</dfn> and how to deal with them. In comparison to a
  complete application, the nominal flow of an application only takes a
  relatively small part of the development effort. The true development cost
  of an application is in the code that deals with <dfn>exceptional
  conditions</dfn>. This is especially true for a web application, where the
  liberties the end-user has, have to be compensated by application code. In
  essence, in all security sensitive applications, undetermined behavior is
  the major risk. If we do not deal with exceptional conditions, it means that
  anything can happen in these conditions, making the application inherently
  unstable and unsafe. And in web applications, based on the very simple,
  stateless HTTP protocol, there are so much more exceptional conditions than
  in a desktop application.</p>
  <h2>My Application Works (If Nothing
  Unexpected Happens)</h2> <p>One popular approach to exception handling is to
  let them all propagate to the final layer, where the user is then presented
  with an error dialog or an error page. This is surely the cheapest way of
  dealing with exceptions: the application essentially crashes, and the user
  is left hanging out to dry. This approach is only acceptable in the most
  simple of demo applications, to show some nominal functionality quickly (and
  then you are cheating your audience). Where in desktop application this
  approach will annoy the user, in web applications, you are potentially
  creating a security hole and the possibility for corruption of your back-end
  data. In a web application, the end user will probably use his back-button,
  and try something else. However, since the previous outcome was unexpected,
  the application is now in an undetermined state, and we cannot know for sure
  even how our nominal code will act when called in this state (in practice,
  the session and application scope is no longer to be trusted). From this
  example it should be clear that, in many cases, a real crash of the
  application is often the best possible outcome, to avoid uncontrolled access
  and data corruption.</p> <h2>Exceptions Are Bothering My Style</h2> <p>Now,
  if you choose this popular approach of letting all exceptions propagate to
  the final layer, working with checked exceptions is cumbersome: each method
  has to declare that it throws the possible exceptions we just want to
  propagate anyway. So, in this frame of mind, an aversion against checked
  exceptions comes naturally. Hence, another popular practice has become for
  frameworks and libraries to use unchecked exceptions (e.g., Spring, the JSF
  specification and Hibernate 3). As we shall see below, this might be an
  acceptable approach for some kinds of exceptional conditions, but certainly
  not for semantic exceptional conditions.</p> <h1>Kinds of Exceptional
  Conditions</h1> <p>Yet, it is not so hard to deal with exceptions properly.
  The first step in dealing with exceptions is to understand the different
  kind of <dfn>exceptional conditions</dfn> that can occur during execution of
  your program. In essence, an <dfn>exceptional condition</dfn> is anything
  that is not explicitly forbidden (<dfn>precondition</dfn>) that keeps your
  code from reaching its nominal effect (<dfn>postcondition</dfn>). Calling
  code in violation of preconditions is not an exceptional condition, but a
  <dfn>programming error</dfn>.</p>
  <p>Every method tries to reach its nominal
  postcondition (which is oftern not completely deterministic in an
  environment with dynamic binding like an object oriented programming
  language). That is its reason for being. During its execution, it might
  encounter exceptional conditions. When this happens, the method can decide
  either to work around this condition, and still reach its nominal
  postcondition, or it can decide to give up. In the first case, the condition
  actually is not considered exceptional, but part of the normal operational
  conditions, in which the nominal effect is reached. In the latter case,
  execution of code should be halted in a controlled fashion. This means that
  nothing in the state of the program should have changed: it should be as if
  the method that cannot reach its nominal postcondition, was never called in
  the first place. The method should be <dfn>atomic</dfn>: either it reaches
  its nominal effect, or it does nothing. Furthermore, the caller of the
  method should be warned about the success or failure of the method call.</p>
  <p>Throwing an <dfn>exception</dfn> is the ideal way for a method to signal
  that it cannot reach its nominal effect as described by the postcondition.
  After detection of the exceptional condition, nominal execution stops, and
  the method makes sure that nothing is changed to the overall state of the
  system (either because the method didn't make a change yet, or because the
  method rolls back all changes it made). Then, it signals its failure by
  throwing an exception.</p> <p>If a method cannot reach its postcondition,
  and it is impossible for the method to behave in an atomic way, the caller
  should be aware of this. The calling method itself should be atomic too, and
  if the called method cannot do this, than the calling method gets the
  burden. If this is a problem for the calling method too, by unwinding the
  call stack, we finally reach the main method (or it's equivalent in a web
  application). Here we have only 1 recourse: quit the application
  gracefully.</p> <p>Now, what are the possible reasons why a correctly
  implemented method, if called in acceptable conditions, i.e., not in
  violation of its preconditions, cannot reach its nominal postcondition? Here
  are 2 major types of conditions:</p> <ol>
      <li>The current state of the system, in particular the state of the
      prime object and the explicit actual arguments of the method call, is
      examined by the code of the method, and the method decided that it can
      (or will) not implement the postcondition in these circumstances for
      <dfn>semantic reasons</dfn>.<br />
      E.g., we want to withdraw money
      from an account, and the requested amount is larger than the balance.
      Or, the first name of a person is mandatory, and we want to set the
      first name of a person from an actual argument, and the argument is
      <code>null</code>.<br />
      This kind of exceptional conditions we will
    call <dfn>semantic exceptional conditions</dfn>.</li>

      <li>CONFUSION STARTS HERE The method could not reach the postcondition for a <dfn>technical
      reason</dfn> outside the system.<br />
      E.g., we are saving data to a
      database, and the connection fails (maybe somebody tripped over a
      network cable). Or, we need to access a webservice, and we can't resolve
      the domain name (maybe our DNS server is down). Or, as a final example,
      the postcondition cannot be reached because the system runs out of
      memory.<br />
      This kind of exceptional conditions we call
    <dfn>technical exceptional conditions</dfn> .</li>
    </ol> <p>The above examples obviously are based on the premise that
  network connection stability, network administrator clumsiness and the
  amount of RAM in the machine are outside the system we are developing. If
  you consider such occurrences to be within the system, you either do not
  consider them exceptional, and consequentially have dealt with them in the
  nominal flow of your code, or you consider the conditions to be of a
  semantic nature. If not, you have a <dfn>programming error</dfn>.</p>
  <p>From this, it follows that the main difference between the 2 presented
  types of conditions is whether they are considered <dfn>internal</dfn> or
  <dfn>external</dfn> to the system. Other <dfn>internal exceptional
  conditions</dfn> might have to do with security, or be technical. Other
  <dfn>external exceptional conditions</dfn> might be of semantic nature,
  e.g., when DB corruption is encountered.</p> <p>Since we want to signal
  exceptional conditions using exceptions, it seems like a good idea to
  introduce different exception classes for these kinds of exceptions.
  Henceforth we shall speak of <dfn>internal exceptions</dfn> and
  <dfn>external exceptions</dfn>, as exceptions that signal issues that are
  considered to be inside the system, which should be dealt with, or outside
  the system, which should result in graceful shutdown, respectively.
  <dfn>Semantic exceptions</dfn> are internal exceptions that signal internal
  exceptional conditions of semantic nature. <dfn>Technical exceptions</dfn>
  signal external exceptional conditions of technical nature, but this
  distinction will prove rather moot later on.</p>
  <p>END OF CONFUSION </p>
  <h1>Programming Errors</h1>
  <p><dfn>Programming errors</dfn> are not exceptional conditions, not in the
  sense that we make mistakes a lot, but in the sense that exceptional
  conditions are still <dfn>expected conditions</dfn>, and <dfn>programming
  errors</dfn> are not. Sadly, software requires the programmer to take into
  account <em>all possible conditions</em> that can occur during the execution
  of his code, exhaustively, for the code to have a chance to be
  correct.<dfn><br />Correctness</dfn> of code is defined as the mathematical
  guarantee that, if a method is called within the boundaries set by its
  preconditions, <em>all</em> method calls will result in either,</p> <ul>
      <li>a nominal end to the method call and a state change that at least
      incorporates the effect described by the postcondition, or,</li>

      <li>an exception being thrown, under conditions described in the
      contract that allow this, and <ul>
          <li>no state change, or</li>

          <li>a documented state change.</li>
        </ul></li>
    </ul> <p>A programming error is anything that (potentially) causes
  different behavior.</p> <p> For a method to be able to guarantee
  correctness, it must take into account in its implementation all possible
  conditions that can occur during execution, that do not violate
  preconditions. In other words, <em>all</em> possible conditions must be
  exhaustively known, and either be listed in the preconditions as
  unacceptable for the method, or be dealt with in the code. The latter can
  mean reaching the nominal effect in those conditions, or throwing an
  exception.<br />
  So, if a method behaves weird when it is called in
  violation of its preconditions, this is not a bug in the implementation of
  the method. Actually, as method implementors, we don't care about this.
  Calling a method in violation of its preconditions is a programming error in
  the implementation of the <em>calling</em> method, not of the called method.
  </p>
  <p> The point I'm trying to make is, that if a condition can occur
  during execution of a method that was <em>not</em> taken into account either
  in the preconditions or in the code, i.e., it is an <dfn>unexpected
  condition</dfn>, you have made a <dfn>programming error</dfn> . Since you
  didn't expect the condition, you didn't reason about how your code behaves
  when it occurs, and as a consequence the state of the entire system has
  become <dfn>undetermined</dfn> : we don't know where we are anymore, and
  anything we do now will have unpredictable consequences. If you look at it
  as having forgotten to list the condition in the method's preconditions, it
  is clear that the calling method will be quite surprised, and since it has
  no clue what happened, it cannot react.<br />
   An <dfn>unexpected
  condition</dfn> is different from an <dfn>expected exceptional
  condition</dfn>. We have reasoned about <dfn>expected conditions</dfn>,
  and </p>
  <ul>
      <li>some we have defined as being outside our scope, and we have
      documented that in preconditions,</li>

      <li>some we have defined exceptional (i.e., we will not try to reach the
      nominal effect under these conditions),</li>

      <li>and some we deal with inside the nominal flow of our code.</li>
  </ul> <p>Note that encountering unexpected conditions is not the only kind
  of programming error possible. You can, e.g., also blatantly fail to reach
  your postcondition, when you typed a <code>-</code> where a <code>+</code>
  was in order. But it is a very important kind of programming error, because
  it is very difficult to always be exhaustively aware of all possible
  conditions.</p> <p>Very many unexpected conditions will turn up as
  unexpected exceptions in Java, like a <code>NullPointerException</code> (we
  didn't take into account the situation where the parameter is
  <code>null</code>), or an <code>ArithmeticException</code> (we forgot the
  nominator variable could be <code>0</code> in a division). But also not
  taking into account a possible <code>ExceptionInInitializerError</code> when
  calling <code>java.lang.reflect.Method.invoke()</code> on a constructor, or
  not taking into account a possible <code>SQLException</code> when executing
  a SQL statement using <code>java.sql.Statement.execute()</code> are
  programming errors of the same kind.</p> <p>Exceptions raised in this
  fashion should not concern a theory of dealing with exceptions in correct
  programs. However, as it stands, we do get them for free, and in a modern
  language like Java or C# much more than in older languages like C, C++ or
  Delphi. Many programming errors that would go unnoticed at first in
  older-generation programming languages, at least are signaled immediately in
  the current generation. This is a very good thing, because the system
  becomes undefined once we executed the buggy code, and anything we do after
  that makes things worse, potentially corrupts our data, or opens up security
  holes. So, while talking about exceptions, it is not a bad thing to take
  these occurrences into account, and to formulate a strategy for dealing with
  them.</p> <h2>Using Checked Exceptions to Deal Exhaustively With All
  Possible Conditions</h2> <p>Consider the fact that it is very hard to always
  be exhaustively aware of all possible conditions. As humans, we can manage
  conditions that are considered to be part of the nominal flow of methods we
  use. Being exhaustively aware of all exceptional conditions for the methods
  we use, or their preconditions, is much more difficult. Now, in these modern
  languages, we can define the exceptional conditions (and in some languages
  even the preconditions, but not in Java) of methods we use, with <em>a
  language construct</em> of which the compiler is aware. This means that,
  while we are programming our code, the compiler in the IDE will exhaustively
  list for us all possible exceptional conditions, and bar us from delivering
  code that does not explicitly deal with these conditions in some way.</p>
  <p>At least, that is, if the exceptional conditions are listed as
  <dfn>checked exceptions</dfn> in the signature of the methods we use. If,
  for a called method, we exhaustively considered all possible conditions, and
  we listed exceptional conditions as checked exceptions that the called
  method can throw (forgetting preconditions for a moment), the compiler will
  make sure that in the calling method's implementation, we considered all
  possible conditions for this particular method call. If the method is
  <dfn>robust</dfn> (there are no preconditions), this means that coverage is
  complete for this one method call, and if this is applied to all code in the
  calling method's implementation, coverage is indeed complete for the entire
  method. This computer assistance is an enormous help in trying to get
  correctness!</p> <p>With this in mind, maybe you can understand <em>my</em>
  aversion against unchecked exceptions. When the methods I use only list
  unchecked exceptions, my IDE can't help me in being aware of all possible
  conditions, and I must revert to looking things up by hand in Javadoc. The
  loss in efficiëncy is enormous. Given, the IDE only warns me about potential
  exceptions. I still need to look up by hand the conditions under which these
  exceptions might be thrown (the Javadoc <code>throws</code> clause), because
  that is what I need to consider in my implementation. But still, the aid I
  get is enormous when compared to no help at all.</p> <h2>Signal Programming
  Errors with Exceptions</h2> <p>Exceptions raised as the result of a
  programming error are a mechanism that allow us to efficiently do what is
  the only thing we can do when these errors do make it to production
  software: gracefully quit the application a.s.a.p., before more harm is
  done.</p> <p>Note that this is the best possible behavior for any sort of
  programming error, not only when unexpected exceptions occur. Programming
  errors that result in an unexpected exception feature this behavior
  naturally. But there is also a large class of programming errors that we
  might detect ourselves.</p>
  <p> A best-practices programming style is to
  write down all thoughts about you're algorithm using <code>assert</code>
  statements. Programmers will recognize this experience: while coding, now
  and then, you sit back and take a look at your method's implementation, and
  you reason about it: can this variable be <code>null</code> here? what does
  my implementation do on a Thursday? etcetera. The whole idea behind this
  programming style is to immediately take down the result of this short
  brainstorm as an assertion. You have just spend some minutes proving to
  yourself that this variable can never be <code>null</code> in this place in
  your code: this proves that this knowledge is not trivial. So, it should
  surely be documented. Now, rather than writing a <code>//</code>-comment,
  by writing an <code>assert</code> -clause, you're assumption will also be
  put to the test during execution (when assertions are enabled). If the
  assertion fails, it means that your reasoning was flawed, and thus that you
  have made a programming error. The <code>assert</code>-mechanism will throw
  an exception when this happens, which is exactly the behavior we said above
  we'd like.<br />
   Now and again, you also encounter the situation where we
  might detect a programming error in the flow of the code. E.g., as the
  result of a test (an <code>else</code> -branch that cannot occur in a large
  decision tree, or a <code>default</code> case in a <code>switch</code>
  -statement), or as an exception that, according to your reasoning, should
  not occur (i.e., an unexpected checked exception, for which you have to
  write a <code>catch</code> -clause anyway). Instead of merely writing a
  comment in these cases, it is a good idea to write <code>assert
  false;</code> as the body of this branch or this <code>catch</code> -clause,
  or throw an exception or an error of another kind (the <code>assert</code>
  -mechanism doesn't provide for extensive reporting on the error; this is
  especially sad when we encounter an unexpected exception, that usually
  carries a lot of interesting debug information; on the other hand, the code
  for throwing an exception cannot be easily disabled using runtime options,
  like assertions). </p> <p>Finally, an important type of programming errors
  is the calling of methods in violation of their preconditions. This kind of
  programming error can, sadly, not be checked statically by the compiler, and
  also cannot not be checked with unit testing (unit testing can only check
  whether postconditions are reached in a number of test cases, that must
  adhere to the preconditions). Again, it is best-practice to take down
  preconditions at the start of your method in code, using an
  <code>assert</code>-clause. Any violation of preconditions while calling
  methods in the implementation of a method will then be signaled, hopefully
  during the test phase of your lifecycle.</p> <p>With these practices in
  place, we know that a large portion of potential programming errors will be
  signaled by the occurrence of either an unexpected exception (which only can
  be an unchecked exception) or a <code>java.lang.AssertionError</code>. I
  also hypothesize that any other kind of programming error is related to not
  reaching the postcondition (including throwing expected exceptions), and
  thus in the realm of unit testing.</p> <p>The above clearly gives the hint
  that unchecked exceptions (and <code>java.lang.Error</code> instances) have
  a role to play in the context of programming errors, and that checked
  exceptions should be used for all expected exceptions. Since we presume to
  write correct software, it does not make sense to foresee programming errors
  in the throws-clause of a method signature. Exceptions that signal
  programming errors are unexpected in essence. Using checked exceptions for
  expected exceptions gives the IDE the opportunity to help us in taking into
  account all possible conditions in our algorithm exhaustively.</p> <h1>What
  to Do With Internal Exceptions, External Exceptions &amp; Programming
  Errors?</h1> <p>Now that we have discerned different kinds of exceptions, we
  need to contemplate what we want to do when they occur.</p> <p> When a
  <dfn>semantic exception</dfn> occurs, we want to block the operation and
  warn the end user, so that he can change his behavior and continue working
  with the program. In my experience, a semantic exception occurs in an
  interactive program when the end user provided faulty input or performed an
  illegal operation (of course, a really good user interface would prohibit
  the user action in these conditions in the first place, but with a classic
  web application that is very hard). In a batch program, a semantic exception
  would only occur with corrupt or incomplete input. I cannot imagine any
  other final reason for a semantic exception then these, but please report
  anything I might have missed. In both cases, it is important that the user
  gets feedback about what he did wrong, for him to be able to correct his
  input or behavior. Also, the same applies for any other kind of
  <dfn>internal exception</dfn> (e.g., security exceptions) that reaches the
  user.<br />
  So, in general, we know what to do. In particular, what we need
  to tell the user exactly and how, depends on the particular kind of
  exception, the exact circumstances in which it occurred, possible i18n
  settings, and more. </p>
  <p> When a <dfn>technical exception</dfn>, or any
  other kind of <dfn>external exception</dfn>, occurs, there is little we can
  do. Since these conditions are, per definition, considered to be outside the
  system, we do not want to deal with them (otherwise, we would consider them
  part of the system). By placing them outside of the system, we are saying
  that we only guarantee correct behavior of our application when they do not
  occur. This may sound very much like a precondition, and in fact it is.
  These are (often implicit) preconditions for the system as a whole.<br />
  When a external exception occurs, we want to inform the user of that fact,
  make clear that it has nothing to do with him, but we also want to notify
  the persons that are responsible for solving the external problem, a.s.a.p.
  The user cannot continue until the problem is fixed, and we exit the
  application gracefully, making sure that no harm has been done.<br />
  So,
  in general, we know what to do. In this case, the message to show to the
  user can be very generic. But again, in particular, what we want to tell the
  administrator has to be very precise for the particular kind of exception
  and the exact circumstances in which it occurred. In this case, view-related
  issues, like i18n, are of lesser or no importance. </p> <p> Again, this is
  very much like what we want to do when a programming error occurs, signaled
  by an unexpected exception. The main difference between these 3 kinds of
  exceptions, expected internal exceptions, expected external exceptions and
  unexpected exceptions, is the audience to which they are of interest:
  expected internal conditions are of interest to the end-user, expected
  external conditions are of interest to the administrator, and unexpected
  conditions are of interest to the developer. Sadly, because exceptions
  necessarily occur at runtime, the end-user is always confronted with them.<br />
  For expected external exceptions, there is nothing we can do: shit
  happens. We apologize to the user, and will correct the situation a.s.a.p.
  With a web application, this is relatively easy to do (mail a trouble ticket
  to the administrator and show a decent page to the end user). For a desktop
  application, this is much more problematic. Either the end-user is the
  administrator, and chances are that he doesn't have the ability to correct
  the problem, or the administrator is unknown to us.<br />
  For unexpected
  exceptions, the problem is greater. The developer is one sizable step
  further removed from the running application. Mailing a trouble ticket is
  feasible, but might be considered a back door by the client, and thus be
  barred for security reasons. On Mac OS X, this is solved for desktop
  applications by presenting the end-user with a dialog that gives him the
  option to mail a trouble ticket to the developers. In a web application, if
  mailing the developers is prohibited, we should at least have very good
  logging. The same applies to expected external exceptions, of course. </p>
  <h2>Dealing With Expected and Unexpected Exceptions in General</h2> <p>From
  the above it should be clear that we should have code that, once and for
  all, implements the general behavior that we want for expected internal
  exceptions, expected external exceptions, and unexpected exceptions.
  Furthermore, it should also be clear, that there is little or no difference
  in dealing with expected external exceptions and unexpected exceptions.</p>
  <p>First of all, we need a mechanism to recognize these different kinds of
  exceptions, so that we can trigger the applicable handling code. Secondly,
  we need the applicable handling code for the different kinds of exceptions,
  and it needs to be constructed in such a way that the appropriate particular
  behavior with respect to the particular kind of exception and the exact
  circumstances, and view-related issues, is executed in some way.</p>
  <h3>Exception Classes</h3> <p>Obviously, in a modern language such as Java,
  the way to recognize the different kinds of exceptions, is to introduce
  different exception classes in an inheritance hierarchy, and to use these
  types in the <code>catch</code>-clause to filter them out of all possible
  exceptions. Therefor, we define a number of general exception classes in
  <code>ppw-exception</code>:</p> <p><img
  src="doc-files/exceptionHierarchy.png" style="width: 100%;"></img></p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <h4>ProgrammingError</h4>
  <p>A {@link be.peopleware.exception_II.ProgrammingError} could be used if an
    <code>assert</code>-clause doesn't carry enough information for debugging
  purposes. Furthermore, <code>assert</code>-functionality is usually disabled
  in deployment after an initial acceptance phase for performance reasons.
  Therefor, it is sensible to use{@link be.peopleware.exception_II.ProgrammingError} instead to
  document branches that should be unreachable (the <code>catch</code>-clause
  of exceptions that shouldn't occur, or <code>else</code>-branches of decision
  trees or <code>default</code> branches of <code>switch</code>-statements
  that should never be choosen). It would be nice if
  <code>AssertionError</code> would be a subclass of {@link be.peopleware.exception_II.ProgrammingError}, but we cannot change the core API, of course.
  Also, the other way around is not feasible, since
  <code>AssertionError</code> doesn't provide a constructuror that takes a
  <code>Throwable</code> as an argument, which is important information in
  some cases. The user should be aware that the reaction higher up to
  this error is probably an immediate shutdown of the application, with a warning to the developer and a note in the log.</p>
  <h4>ExternalError</h4>
  <p>An {@link be.peopleware.exception_II.ExternalError} should be used whenever an operation fails
  because of expected reasons we decide are outside our system.  When you decide to throw this error,
  you should know that the reaction higher up probably is to shut down the
  system, with a warning to the developer and a note in the log. We have choosen to use an <code>Error</code> here, because we feel
  that code higher up should not be concerned with occurrences like these (we
  do consider the occurrence outside the system, remember), unless it is the
  code that is specifically handling external errors. The exception thus should
  best be unchecked, and by providing a specific exception type for these
  occurrences, it becomes easy to detect them at the higher levels, and write
  the handling code in a general way. We could also have choosen to make {@link be.peopleware.exception_II.ExternalError} a <code>RuntimeException</code> (i.e., an unchecked
  exception), we we believe the documented semantics of <code>Error</code> are
  closer to our need.</p>
  <h4>InternalException</h4>
  <p>{@link be.peopleware.exception_II.InternalException} is the general super type for all exceptions that signal expected exceptional occurences that we consider to be internal to the system. These should be dealt with, and to notify the programmer of this during development, this is a checked exception. The difference with other checked exceptions is that, by throwing an {@link be.peopleware.exception_II.InternalException}, we are telling our users that we decided that this occurence indeed <em>is</em> internal, and should be handled.</p>
  <p>Other checked exceptions should be used, in particular by lower level libraries, to signal exceptional occurences, when the developer of that code does not want to decide whether or not the condition is to be considered internal or external, or a programming error. Take, e.g., a persistence library, that might need to signal that a file is corrupt. Some programs that use the library will consider this problem to be external, but the library can also be used by an application that specifically scans for corrupt files, in which case the condition is obviously internal. The point is, the lower level library is supporting code, and is not in a position to make the call. For reasons explained higher, I strongly believe that such a library should throw checked exceptions, though.</p>
  <h4>SecurityException</h4>
  <p>{@link be.peopleware.exception_II.SemanticException} is a subtype of {@link be.peopleware.exception_II.InternalException}, to be used as supertype to signal security related exceptional conditions.</p>
  <p>At the moment, there are no general subtypes defined, and this exception has no special properties. This will probably change as the library evolves. </p>
  <h4>SemanticException </h4>
  <p>{@link be.peopleware.exception_II.SemanticException} signal that their was a semantic exceptional condition. Most often, this is related to what is more commonly known as <dfn>validation</dfn>.</p>
  <p>BeanException</p>
  <p>CompoundException</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>NOT RIGHT: HANDLING CODE SHOULD DO THE
  LOGGING? BUT THEN WE ARE NOT USING THE RIGHT LOG? NOT SURE!</p> <p></p>
  <p>LOOK FOR A LOGGER FOR ALL CLASSES IN THE STACKTRACE, USE ONE CLOSEST BY!

    be handled by special handling code, that is triggered by <code>AssertionErrors</code> and{@link be.peopleware.exception_II.ProgrammingError}, but also by
    any other unchecked exception (<code>RuntimeException</code>) or <code>Error</code> that reaches the
    handling layer. But since a layer handling {@link be.peopleware.exception_II.ExternalError ExternalErrors} should be defined immediately below this layer, and checked exceptions, most
    notably {@link be.peopleware.exception_II.InternalException InternalExceptions}, are normally dealt with much
    earlier, this handling code should handle all <code>Throwables</code> that
    reach this layer. If {@link be.peopleware.exception_II.ExternalError ExternalErrors} or checked exceptions do
    reach the handling code, that is a programming error in itself. The handling
    code can benefit from getting <code>AssertionErrors</code> or{@link be.peopleware.exception_II.ProgrammingError}, because they make it possible to give more
  precise feedback about the programming error.</p>
  <p>The handling should catch the exception, log it, possibly notify the correct audience, and exit the application. The latter can possibly be done most easily by rethrowing the caucht exception. LOG LEVEL??? </p>

  <p>Abscence of proof is not proof of absence.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <h2>The
  Audience of Compilation Errors</h2> <p> As a side note, now that we are
  talking about the audiences for signaling issues, consider compilation
  problems. A failed compile is a signal of a programming error to the right
  audience, at the right time: the developer, during development. This is the
  exact reason why strongly typed, compiled languages are to be preferred over
  weakly typed or scripting languages: the compile phase is a validation at
  the right time in the right context. Any programming error that can be
  determined by an automated, static process is a programming error that will
  not make it to the end-user, guaranteed. Programming languages that offer
  more development-time validation are inherently better for production
  software. <br /> Assertions and unexpected exceptions are merely a stopgap
  measure for validation that cannot occur statically at development-time.
  Also, the concept of testing is introduced in the software development
  lifecycle as a stopgap measure for the same problem: we hope that
  programming errors will surface close to the developer, before the product
  is shipped, by executing the code under as many conditions as possible, and
  comparing the actual results of operations to expected results (an
  unexpected exception, by the way, is always a deviation of the expected
  result). But note that testing never guarantees correctness, the way formal
  static verification does. The absence of failed tests doesn't guarantee the
  absence of errors. <br /> Also note that testing implies testing for
  expected exceptions too: getting an exception in documented circumstances is
  part of the expected behavior, as is the fact that the state of the system
  is not changed when an exception occurs, or the change that does happen, is
  documented. </p> <h1>Kinds of Exceptions</h1> <p>Since we need to react
  differently to different kinds of exceptional conditions, and exceptions are
  the best way to signal exceptional conditions, it is clear that we should
  make clear which kind of condition occurred as part of the exception.</p>
  <p>Modern programming languages like Java and C# make this extremely easy:
  exceptions of different types can exist, and the mechanism for catching the
  exceptions is especially tweaked to allow different reactions to different
  types of exceptions.</p> <p>Therefor, one of the main contributions of the
  <code>ppw-exceptions</code> library is the formal introduction of a
  <code>SemanticException</code> type and a <code>TechnicalException</code>
  type. Yet, still we need more specialized exceptions, for particular
  conditions. As described above, we need to communicate particular
  information about the actual condition (to the end-user or the
  administrator). The place where we are throwing the exception is where we
  have the most complete information about the actual condition possible. The
  further away we move from this place, the less complete the information we
  have becomes. On the other hand, this is not the place to communicate with
  the user. First of all, the code that is calling us might still need to deal
  with the exception itself. It might even deal with the situation itself,
  without notifying the end-user or the administrator. What is exceptional to
  us, might be nominal to code above us. Furthermore, advocating a clean
  separation-of-concerns, if we are now in a layer that is not the
  presentation layer, we should not concern ourselfs with end-user
  communication. We should merely, semantically, gather the information
  necessary, and report this information to the code that called us.</p>
  <h1>Going Through Layers</h1> <h1>When to Throw Exceptions</h1> <p>Now that
  it is clear what we want to do with exceptions finally, we can turn to the
  question when to throw exceptions. Again, we can consider the different
  kinds of exceptional conditions.</p> <p>In general, we want to throw an
  exception when we cannot not or will not reach the nominal effect of the
  method we are implementing. As described, in correct code, this can be for
  semantic reasons or for technical reasons.</p> <p>But when?</p>
  <p>Recognize</p> <p>we don't know that something is a programming error! so
  we can't throw them, only decide what to do them when we get one; difficult
  to recognize</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>Hey! That is the reasoning above about I
  don't care!</p> <h1>Delivering Correct Software</h1> <p>I must presume that
  we all want to deliver correct software. But we all know that is not trivial
  to. What is a good strategy to handle programming errors?</p> <p>First of
  all, we should have a strategy that is aimed at discovering programming
  errors when the software is still in the hands of the programmers, before it
  is delivered. Secondly, we should have a strategy for dealing with
  programming errors that still remain in the software after it is deployed,
  despite our efforts.</p> <p>usual things, prove, peer review, unit testing,
  integration testing, testing,</p> <p>acceptance testing by selected
  audience</p> <p>For dealing with programming errors that still surface when
  the software is deployed, we take into account the fact that this will be a
  rare occurrence. So we should not put too many effort in it. In this case it
  sadly is the end-user that is confronted with the error, so we need some
  blabla.</p> <p>assert good enough; disable when you feel safe.</p> <p>assert
  is good!!!!</p> <h1>Checked Exceptions, Unchecked Exceptions and Errors</h1>
  <p>Unchecked exceptions (and that includes errors) should be used to signal
  programming errors or technical exceptional conditions.</p> <p>Problem is
  that that cannot be defined from the standpoint of the called method or
  operation: it can be called in different modes, and sometimes these are
  semantic or technical or error: the caller decides that, not the
  callee.</p></body>
