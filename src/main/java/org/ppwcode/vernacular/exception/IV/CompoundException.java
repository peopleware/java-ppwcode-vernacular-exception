/**
 * <p>Compound exceptions make it possible for a method to signal several semantic issues
 *   at once.</p>
 * <p>With single exceptions, a method can report 1 exceptional condition. Often, there are more reasons
 *   possible to reject nominal execution. A traditional implementation tests the conditions one by one,
 *   and throws an exception when the first failure of occurs. This can than be reported to the end user,
 *   but once this mistake is corrected, it often results in the next rejection. This is especially annoying
 *   in web applications, that have a long round trip.</p>
 * <p>Compound exceptions make it possible to implement validation in such a way that all validation is done
 *   every time. A validation failure is stored and remembered until all validation is done, and then collected
 *   in a compound exception, which makes it possible to provide full feedback on validity to the end user in
 *   one pass.</p>
 * <p>Compound exceptions are build during a certain time, and migth eventually be thrown or not be
 *   thrown. An {@link #isEmpty() empty} compound exception should never be thrown. Before a compound
 *   exception is thrown, it should be {@link #isClosed closed}.</p>
 * <p>Compound exceptions are meant as a flat list. You should not nest compound property exceptions.
 *   This also avoids cyclic element exceptions.</p>
