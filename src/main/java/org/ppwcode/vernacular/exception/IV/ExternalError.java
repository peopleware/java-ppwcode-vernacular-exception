/**
 * <p>This error is thrown when an external condition occurs, which we know can happen
 *   (however unlikely), which we do not want to deal with in our application. Most often,
 *   these are exceptional conditions are of a technical nature. These conditions are
 *   considered preconditions on the system level. Examples are a disk that is full,
 *   a network connection that cannot be established, a power failure, etcetera.
 *   The indented audience of these errors is neither the end user, nor the developer,
 *   but the <em>administrator</em>, who is responsible for system configuration,
 *   integration and infrastructure.</p>
 * <p>The {@link #getMessage() message} should express the error as closely as possible.
 *   It is the only channel to which to communicate to the administrator what went wrong.
 *   If you cannot pinpoint the exact nature of the error, the message should say so
 *   explicitly. If you become aware of the external condition you do not want to deal
 *   with through an {@link Exception} or an {@link Error}, it should be carried
 *   by an instance of this class as its {@link #getCause() cause}.</p>
 * <p>These errors should not be mentioned in the exception part of a method contract.
 *   They could be mentioned in the preconditions of a method contract, but in general
 *   this is not appropriate. {@code ExternalError}s are a mechanism to signal
 *   <dfn>system precondition</dfn> violations to administrators, it is not a part of the
 *   contract between developers, but rather a contract between developers in general and
 *   the system administrator. These errors could be documented in a document that
 *   communicates between developers and administrators (e.g., {@code web.xml} for web
 *   applications), and this should be done in specific cases. But most often, these
 *   system preconditions are considered implicit (e.g., when we need a database, it is
 *   implied that the database connection works).</p>
 * <p>It probably does not make sense to create subtypes of this error for specific
 *   situations. There is no need for internationalization for external errors. If there
 *   is extra information that we can communicate to the administrator, we can add it to
 *   the message.</p>
