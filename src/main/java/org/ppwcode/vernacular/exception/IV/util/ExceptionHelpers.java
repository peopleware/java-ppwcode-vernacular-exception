  /**
   * <p>Hunt for a {@link Throwable}  of type {@code exceptionType} in the exception chain carried by
   *   {@code exc}. This is a deeper {@code catch}.</p>
   * <p>The Java {@code catch} statement only catches exceptions of a given type if the top exception is
   *   of that type itself. Often however, exceptions are wrapped in exceptions of other types as they
   *   pass through the layers of an application (from persistence over semantics and logic towards the
   *   user). This method is intended to be used inside a more general {@code catch} statement to hunt
   *   for an exception of a specific type in those nested exceptions.</p>
   * <p>Since Java 1.4, {@link Throwable Throwables} all support a {@link Throwable#getCause() cause}
   *   to carry such wrapped exceptions. However, before that time, such a pattern was introduced ad hoc
   *   in some exception types in different parts of the Java API. This method looks for exceptions
   *   in the {@link Throwable#getCause() cause}, and in the wrapped exceptions used by a number of those
   *   ad hoc patterns. Since a number of these parts of the Java API are not part of Java SE, and thus
   *   they require extra libraries, the code below takes great care to use reflection to avoid a
   *   dependency of this library on those optional libraries. In other words, we check for exceptions
   *   in the wrapped chains for specific types, if we can find those types in the classpath, and we
   *   do not check if those types are not found in the classpath. In all these cases, the specialized
   *   patterns get precedence over the general {@link Throwable#getCause() cause} chain.</p>
   * <p>In the current version, we look for exceptions in:</p>
   * <ul>
   *   <li>the {@link SQLException#getNextException() next exception} of a {@link SQLException};
   *       this also works for the {@link SQLWarning#getNextWarning() next warning} of a
   *       {@link SQLWarning}</li>
   * </ul>
   * <p>We do no longer threat the following cases, since the Javadoc says the use of the specialized
   *   patters is deprecated:</p>
   * <ul>
   *   <li>the {@code JspException.getRootCause() root cause} of a {@code javax.servlet.jsp.JspException} (since JavaEE 5)</li>
   *   <li>the {@code ELException.getRootCause()} root cause} of an {@code javax.servlet.jsp.el.ELException} (since JavaEE 5)</li>
   * </ul>
   *
   * <p>Note: More checks will be added as more, relevant, exception classes are discovered that use another
   *   method than {@link Throwable#getCause()} as inspector in an exception chaining mechanisms.
   *   This property of {@link Throwable} was added since 1.4, and the entire JSE API has been
   *   retrofitted since.</p>
   * <p>Note: There are currently no specialized cases we need to address via reflection. Exception cases
   *   of the previous version in Java EE are deprecated and retrofitted in Java EE 5.</p>
   * <p>Note: There is a dependency cycle problem at the moment with the reflection code. We would like to
   *   use the code from ppwcode util reflection to do this work, but at the moment that library
   *   depends on us. Luckily, in this version, we have no need for the reflection code.
   *   Beware however if you have to reintroduce reflection code in the future.</p>
