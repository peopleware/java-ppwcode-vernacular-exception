    <release version="II v1.0.2/1.0" date="2006-06-22" description="Serializability">
      <action dev="jand" type="fix">
        NavigationStack is now Serializable, is it always should have been.
        For this to be possible, NavigationInstances have to be Serializable too,
        as they always should have been. This change cannot break existing correct
        applications, since NavigationInstances always should have been Serializable.
        If there are existing applications that add non-serializable NavigationInstances
        to the stack, this will show up as an exception when the application is
        serialized. This will have been the case with such applications before
        since those NavigationInstances will always have existed in sessions scope.
