<p>The development of user
interfaces for web applications is a tedious job. On the one hand,
there is the fact that the HTTP protocol is stateless (we do not have
that much issue with HTML/CSS as a display technology). On the other
hand, we know fairly well how to create MVC-desktop-clients user
interfaces (using Swing or eclipse RCP, or Delphi), and we know that
this is manageable. JSF tries to reconcile these 2 positions, and
certainly has some benefits. However, a lot about JSF stays mysterious:
there is no clear development philosophy, some parts are lacking. </p>
<p>What is positive about JSF is
the component market place that it is being created, and the clear
request/response life-cycle. We have some issues with this life-cycle,
but the fact that it is standardized is positive. To us, it is clear
that JSF was developed with <em>simple</em>
webapplication user interfaces in mind: 1 page to interact with 1
business object, and that's it. There notably is a lack in guidelines,
development philosophy and support for more complex semantic object
graphs. JSF is certainly a step forward for UIs where a user is taken
through several steps before his interaction with a business object is
complete (wizard style). This was a problem with earlier frameworks
like Struts.</p>
<h2>Background</h2>
<h3>Desktop Applications (komt overeen met tweede soort UI, of toch in
apart puntje?)
</h3>
<p>In a desktop-MVC-application, a UI consists at
each moment of a set of windows, where each window (in general)
represents a
semantic object (and it's downstream related objects). There can be
more than 1 window open for a given semantic object, either presenting
the same or a different view. In RAM, we hold semantic objects, and an
object structure for each open window (and possibly some in reserve,
that are currently not open), that has a reference to the semantic
object it is a view of.</p>
<p>E.g., we have a <code>Person</code>
instance <code>p</code>,
and a number of <code>PersonFrame</code>
instances referring to <code>p</code>.
The <code>PersonFrame</code>
instances are an aggregate of Swing component instances, such as
panels, frames, text fields, drop-down boxes, layout managers,
etcetera.</p>
<h3>User Interfaces</h3>
<p>There are essentially 2 kinds of user interfaces: those where
there is exactly 1 window instance per <span
 style="font-style: italic;">type</span> of semantic object, and
those where there is 1 window instance per semantic instance. <br>
</p>
<p>In the
first kind, the window is actually a singleton. This kind of UI
descends from the elder days, when UI widgets were a rare, OS
controlled resource (think X terminals and X11, e.g.). These machines
were really RAM-deprived, and UIs were designed in such a way that the
data structure to display a type of object was reused, in time, for
different objects of that type. To display an object, we grab the
applicable data structure from RAM (or create it if it did not exist
yet), and overwrite whatever data is there now, with data from the
instance we wish to display. In effect, we connect the window to a
specific instance, and it is now no longer connected to the instance it
displayed earlier.</p>
<p>We have more RAM and speedier
processors now, and creating a new data structure for each instance we
want to display, and keeping it in RAM, is not really an issue anymore.
The semantic object will store the semantic state, and the
display-object-structure will store view-related state (e.g., which
elements of a tree are open, which tabs are shown, whether a button is
enabled or not, &hellip;). So, the second kind of UI is made possible.</p>
<h3>MVC</h3>
<p>In MVC fashion, the connection between
the display-objects and the semantic objects, is 2-way. The
display-object-structure (<dfn>view</dfn>)
listens to events from the semantic object (<dfn>model</dfn>)
that signal changes in the model, and the <dfn>controller</dfn>
initiates changes on the semantic object, immediately in response to
events that signal
end-user actions. This loose-coupling
via events and listeners is at the heart of the original MVC pattern,
and makes it possible to have multiple windows to display the same
semantic object. Note that if there is no need for multiple windows,
there is no need for this loose-MVC-coupling. <br>
</p>
<p>In the elder UI design
described above, user interaction was dealt with through call-back
methods, and display was dealt with by pulling data from the semantic
object. Keeping the semantic object in RAM after the data is fetched,
is not really needed.</p>

<h3>Multiple Window Instances per Semantic Object
</h3>
<p>In a desktop-MVC-application, a UI consists at
each moment of a set of windows, where each window (in general)
represents a
semantic object (and it's downstream related objects). There can be
more than 1 window open for a given semantic object, either presenting
the same or a different view. In RAM, we hold semantic objects, and an
object structure for each open window (and possibly some in reserve,
that are currently not open), that has a reference to the semantic
object it is a view of.</p>

<p>The connection between
the display-objects and the semantic objects follows the MVC pattern,
which is 2-way. The
display-object-structure (<dfn>view</dfn>)
listens to events from the semantic object (<dfn>model</dfn>)
that signal changes in the model, and the <dfn>controller</dfn>
initiates changes on the semantic object, immediately in response to

via events and listeners is at the heart of the original MVC pattern,
and makes it possible to have multiple windows to display the same
semantic object. Note that if there is no need for multiple windows,
there is no need for this loose-MVC-coupling.<br>

<h3>One Window Instance per Semantic Object<br>
</h3>
<p>In the
first kind, the window is actually a singleton. This kind of UI
descends from the elder days, when UI widgets were a rare, OS
controlled resource (think X terminals and X11, e.g.). These machines
were really RAM-deprived, and UIs were designed in such a way that the
data structure to display a type of object was reused, in time, for

</p>
<h2>JSF Page Design (titel ok ?)</h2>
In a JSF application, the display-object-structure is composed of the
JSF
UIView and 1 or more handlers. They should therefore store
display-related
information. However, where in a true MVC desktop application, we would
have at least 1 such structure per semantic object (we could have more
than 1 if we display the same semantic object in more than 1 window
simultaneously), in a JSF application, we only have 1 such structure
per semantic object <em>type</em>.
Normally, you create 1 JSF page per semantic object type, and 1 JSF
page (URL) creates 1 UIView, identified by a view id that is the URL.
Furthermore, 1 such UIView is backed normally by 1 or more handlers.<br>
<br>
In any case, we see no
possibility to have more than 1 UIView per semantic object <em>type</em>.
--&gt; waarom?<br>
<p>Now, we could devise a way to have a separate handler object per
semantic
object (e.g., by using a managed map, with a separate entry per
semantic object, with the semantic object's PK as key in the map;
accessing the handler and its semantic object from a JSF component
could then be done as follows: <code>#{handlerMap[9859032].instance}</code>
instead of the <code>#{myHandler.instance}</code>
you are accustomed to see). It is not immediately clear how to do this
for more than 1 handler per semantic object (to show the same object in
more than 1 window e.g., because HTTP does not support an
identification scheme for windows -- yet). <br>
</p>
<p>An aspect of real desktop MVC
applications is that data is pushed from the semantics to the view
layer, when changes happen, through events. This makes it possible to
give feedback about changes to the user immediately and interactively.
Now, this push-design is impossible for web applications anyway,
because of the limitations of HTTP. We can only tell things to the user
in response to a request from the browser. This implies a pull-design.</p>
<p>--&gt; ook een reden waarom vershillende windows moeilijk zijn?</p>
<span style="font-style: italic;">Conclusion</span>: In JSF, we should
design UIs where there is 1 window (page) per semantic
object <em>type </em><span style="color: rgb(204, 51, 204);">(volgens
mij moet hier page staan, omdat we verderop wel praten over het opage
!= window)<br>
</span>
<p>It seems to us that the
elder approach to UI development is closer to JSF technology than the
modern, desktop-client, MVC pattern.</p>
<h2>State</h2>
<p>The RAM
limitations that played in the early GUIs play in web applications
again: 1 machine (or cluster) serves multiple (1 to 100&nbsp;000)
concurrent users. Keeping the complete state of all these users in RAM
is impossible. And from experience we know that even for small numbers
of users this poses problems for advanced applications. If a desktop
application uses 200MB of RAM, this is not an issue. For a web
application to use more than 2MB per user, is. On the other hand, web
application containers support externalizing this state through
serialization. A web container such as Tomcat will, if necessary, write
the entire session of a user to a serialized file on disk, and reload
it when the next request of this user arrives. <span
 class="codingGuideline">This requires all objects
that are directly or indirectly reachable from the session to be <code>Serializable</code></span>,
but that is not difficult. This serializability is also needed to
enable
clustering, load balancing, continuity and fault tolerance in web
applications, and needed for semantic objects if you work with an
application server via RMI anyway. Then again, this serialization will
happen at the end of each request / response-cycle, and takes time and
resources itself. Writing 200MB to disk (and reloading it on the next
request) is not an option. <span class="codingGuideline">This implies
that it is
necessary to remove data that does not have to be remembered at the end
of the request&nbsp; / response-cycle.<code></code></span></p>
<p>If there is state to keep,
sending state around to the next request / response-cycle via the
browser is bad for
internet applications (bandwidth). So, state has to be kept in the
server.</p>
<p>Since the HTTP is stateless, the developent of a stateless web
application UI is easy. But this is not what we want. In general, we
need to remember some state between requests.<br>
</p>
<p>Which state do we need to remember?</p>
<ol>
  <li>user identification</li>
  <li>possibly navigation logic
state (PK of current object, history)</li>
  <li>possibly view state</li>
  <li>possibly some semantic state
in a wizard-style operations</li>
</ol>
<span class="codingGuideline"></span>
<p><span style="font-style: italic;">Conclusion</span>: State has to be
kept in the server, but it is necessary to store as little state as
possible between requests.</p>
<h2>Storing Navigation Logic State</h2>
<p><span class="codingGuideline">We think it is best to
keep the id of the semantic object corresponding to a JSF page in the
page itself.</span> We do not like storing state in a JSF page, but
this way
of working seems to avoid problems when opening JSF pages in multiple
windows. For instance, a JSF page representing a patient p1 is opened
in one page in edit mode; the same page is opened in another window,
and we navigate to another window, representing patient p2. When we
submit the values in the first window, the values will be stored in the
wrong patient,&nbsp; namely p2 instead of p1. <br>
</p>
<p>Storing the id of the semantic
page in the JSF page could be done as follows: the id is stored in a
hidden field (h:inputHidden) whose immediate attribute is set to true.
This means that the id will be set early in the life cycle. When
setting the id, the setId method is called which will, as a
side-effect, load the corresponding object from the database and
perform any other necessary initialization of the handler. The id in
the handler has to be set to null at the end of the request / response
cycle to force the setId method to be executed in the next phase.</p>
